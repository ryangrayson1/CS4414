We believe the perpetrator to be John Bradley. He is listed as the author of the fourth file we extracted, an eps file, a heat map with what seems to be a computer memory layout representation.

We extracted 4 files with UID 10578 and GID 1231:
- a pdf file with slides about Device Drivers in block 231, file size 1209645 bytes.
- a gif file with a heat map on a computer memory representation, zoomed out to include L2 left, right, and bottom in block 231, file size 12784 bytes.
- a tiff file that is the white jade dragon in block 231, file size 7306130 bytes.
- an eps file containing another heat map similar to the gif file but zoomed in block 231, file size 159322 bytes.
